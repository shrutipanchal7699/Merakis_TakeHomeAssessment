Imaging a loading dock, a ship with containers. Given an array of tags
representing the container type that needs to be loaded. Thereâ€™s only one
container crane that can be used to load a container. Containers can be loaded in
whatever order. Each container is loaded in one time unit. For each time unit, the
loading crane can complete loading one container or just stay idle (aka. Do
nothing).
Now, there's an additional integer M (>=0) that represents the wait time needed
between loading two containers of the same type (tag). This means that there
should be at least M time units between loading any two containers of the same
type.
Return the smallest number of time units that it will take the container crane to
finish loading all the containers.
